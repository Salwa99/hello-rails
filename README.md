# Hello Rails exercise

In this exercise I create my first ror application, which displays **Hello Rails** in the main page

### Main objectives of this exercise:

- Install `Ruby on Rails` framework.
- Use `RubyGems` as a software package system.

### To run this project:

- Make sure that you setup a `Postgres` database.
- Run `rails server` and visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser!


_Happy coding ❤️_
